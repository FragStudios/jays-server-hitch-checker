Put in any server file and this should work fine ðŸ˜Š

Using console listener to find if the string == "server thread hitch warning"

Then logs to discord based on this...

Also does other simple checks for some Rockstar editor things but you can remove if you like. 

For now it only displays thread hitch warnings only if your in the game because for some reason it requires a client to trigger the command to console. I guess if anyone can PR it, go for it too. I'm sure it still needs work but may be useful to someone
